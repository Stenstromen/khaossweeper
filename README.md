# KhaosSweeper

![Mine](./mine.png)

You've heard of [Chaos Monkey](https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/), you've heard of [Kube DOOM](https://github.com/storax/kubedoom), now get ready for KhaosSweeper!
A minesweeper game that randomly kills pods in your Kubernetes cluster, when a mine is hit, because why not?

Built using Go, FyneV2 and k8s.io/client-go. KhaosSweeper is a simple minesweeper clone that randomly kills pods in your Kubernetes cluster when a mine is hit. It's a fun way to test your cluster's resilience to failures.

*Disclaimer: This minesweeper clone is rigged. It does not follow the rules of the original game. There is no way to win. You will lose. You will lose pods. You will lose pods randomly. You will lose pods randomly and often. You will lose pods randomly and often and there is nothing you can do about it. You have been warned.*
